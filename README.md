Getting and Cleaning Data Peer Assessment Assignment

To change the default working directory the variable WORKINGDIR must be changed to the desired directory.

To run the script just type source("run_analysis.R) in the R terminal.

The script will check if there is a "data" subdirectory, if not, it will be created. Then it will check if the assignment dataset has already been downloaded, if not, it will be downloaded.

Then it will go through the required steps to clean the data and create two datasets in the working directory.
